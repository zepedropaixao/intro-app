Simple Android application built to present yourself to someone. The purpose of this app is to showcase all the information about yourself in a fun way, by going through all the "anatomical" parts of yourself, meaning, here people can know about what is your hear, what is in your feet (meaning what you have done until now, which trail have you gone through in life), etc.
